<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>Renders all entities in the world.<p>The optional tween parameter can be used to render 
    entities at a point somewhere between their captured position and their 
    current position. A tween value of 0 will render entities at their captured 
    position, a tween value of 1 will render entities at their current position. 
    Other values may be used for interpolation. Defaults to 1.<p>Tweening is a 
    technique used to allow games to have their game logic updated a fixed amount 
    of times, e.g. 30, while having Blitz3D interpolate between these game logic 
    updates to render as many frames per second as it can, e.g. 60+, with each 
    frame different to the last.<p>This results in a game which only has to have 
    its game logic updated at half the rate of the renders per second, freeing 
    up CPU time, while at the same time having the game run as smooth as 
    possible on anybody's machine.<p>Render tweening is quite an 
    advanced technique, and it is not necessary to use it, so don't worry if you don't quite understand it. See the 
    castle demo included in the mak (nickname of Mark Sibly, author of Blitz3D) 
    directory of the Blitz3D samples section for a demonstration of render 
    tweening. </td>
