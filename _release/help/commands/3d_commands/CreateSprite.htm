<p class="header">Description:<br>
  <br>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>Creates a sprite entity and returns its handle.<p>The sprite will be 
    positioned at 0,0,0 and extend from 1,-1 to +1,+1.</p>
    <p>A sprite entity is a flat, square (which can be made rectangular by 
    scaling it) 3D object.</p>
    <p>Sprites have two real strengths. The first is that they consist of only 
    two polygons; meaning you can use many of them at once. This makes them 
    ideal for particle effects and 2D-using-3D games where you want lots of 
    sprites on-screen at once.</p>
    <p>Secondly, sprites can be assigned a view mode using
    <a href="SpriteViewMode.htm">SpriteViewMode</a>. By default this view mode 
    is set to 1, which means the sprite will always face the camera. So no 
    matter what the orientation of the camera is relative to the sprite, you 
    will never actually notice that they are flat; by giving them a spherical 
    texture, you can make them appear to look no different than a normal sphere.</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>The optional parent parameter allow you to specify a parent entity for 
    the sprite so that when the parent is moved the child sprite will move with 
    it. However, this relationship is one way; applying movement commands to the 
    child will not affect the parent.</p>
    <p>Specifying a parent entity will still result in the sprite being created 
    at position 0,0,0 rather than at the parent entity's position.</p>
