    <td>Flips all the triangles in a mesh.<p>This is useful for a couple of reasons. 
    Firstly though, it is important to understand a little bit of the theory 
    behind 3D graphics. A 3D triangle is represented by three points; only when 
    these points are presented to the viewer in a clockwise-fashion is the 
    triangle visible. So really, triangles only have one side.</p>
    <p>Normally, for example in the case of a sphere, a model's triangles face 
    the inside of the model, so it doesn't matter that you can't see them. 
    However, what about if you wanted to use the sphere as a huge sky for your 
    world, i.e. so you only needed to see the inside? In this case you would 
    just use FlipMesh.<br>
    <br>
    Another use for FlipMesh is to make objects two-sided, so you can see them 
    from the inside and outside if you can't already. In this case, you can copy 
    the original mesh using <a href="CopyEntity.htm">CopyEntity</a>, specifying 
    the original mesh as the parent, and flip it using FlipMesh. You will now 
    have two meshes occupying the same space - this will make it double-sided, 
    but beware, it will also double the polygon count!</p>
    <p>The above technique is worth trying when an external modelling program 
    has exported a model in such a way that some of the triangles appear to be 
    missing.</td>
