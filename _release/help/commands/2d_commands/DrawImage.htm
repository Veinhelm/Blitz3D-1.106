x = the 'x' location of the screen to display the graphic<br>
y = the 'y' location of the screen to display the graphic<br>
frame = the frame number of the AnimImage to display (optional; 0 is assumed)<br></td></tr></table><p class='header'>Command Description: <br><br><table width='100%' border='0' cellspacing='2' cellpadding='2' align='center'><tr><td>This command draws a previously loaded graphic.  This command draws both single image graphics (loaded with the <a href='LoadImage.htm'>LoadImage</a> command) as well as animated images (loaded with the <a href='LoadAnimImage.htm'>LoadAnimImage</a> command).<br>
<br>
You specify where on the screen you wish the image to appear.  You can actually 'draw' off the screen as well by using negative values or positive values that are not visible 'on the screen'.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you are using an animated image (loaded with the <a href='LoadAnimImage.htm'>LoadAnimImage</a>), you can specify which frame of the imagestrip is displayed with the DrawImage command.<br>
<br>
One of the most common problems new Blitz programmers face when using drawing commands is that even though they draw the graphic to the screen, they never see it!<br>
<br>
Remember, Blitz Basic is fast ... too fast for the human eye.  You will have to either continuously draw the image over and over again (like the way a cartoon or TV works), clearing the screen each time a change is made (this is called double buffering); or you will need to delay Blitz's execution long enough in 'human time' to let you SEE the picture.  We will do the double buffering approach.<br></td></tr></table><p class='header'>Example: <br><br><table width='100%' border='0' cellspacing='2' cellpadding='2' align='center'><tr><td>; LoadImage and DrawImage example<br>
