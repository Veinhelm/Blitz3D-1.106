Why would you want to do this?  Perhaps you have different sets of sounds for different levels of your game?  Perhaps your music loop changes from level to level.  You want to do the RIGHT thing and manage your own resources.  Just because you CAN load every sample for the whole game at once, consider someone that doesn't have as much memory as you do.  You want to ensure that your game appeals to the widest audience possible.  Note: You don't have to manually free these resources when your program terminates - Blitz does this automatically.</td></tr></table><p class='header'>Example: <br><br><table width='100%' border='0' cellspacing='2' cellpadding='2' align='center'><tr><td>; Load a sound into memory<br>
